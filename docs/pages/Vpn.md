UAVcast currently supports OpenVPN without the need for any additional software running on the Raspberry Pi.

##OpenVPN

OpenVPN routes all traffic between your devices through a server.
You can setup a OpenVPN server or find a provider that can host it for you.

For more information about setting up OpenVPN, please see the [Open VPN Wiki](https://community.openvpn.net/openvpn/wiki).

##Zerotier
Zerotier establishes a direct connection between the connected devices, even if they are behind a NAT.

UAVcast does not have this package pre-installed due to the license policy. Please refer to theirs site for installation and usage on your Raspberry Pi.
