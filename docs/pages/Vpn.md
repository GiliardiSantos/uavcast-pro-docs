UAVcast currently supports Zerotier and OpenVPN without the need for any additional software running on the Raspberry Pi.

##Zerotier
[Zerotier](https://www.zerotier.com/) establishes a direct connection between your devices even if they are behind a NAT. Zerotier is extremely easy to setup and is free to use.

!!! note
    Depending on your cellular providers NAT policy - if you are having issues with video streaming over UDP, try using a TCP for your connections or try OpenVPN.

##OpenVPN

OpenVPN routes all traffic between your devices through a server.

You can setup a OpenVPN server or find a provider that can host it for you.

For more information about setting up OpenVPN, please see the [Open VPN Wiki](https://community.openvpn.net/openvpn/wiki).
