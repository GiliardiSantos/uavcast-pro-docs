##Start / Stop UAVcast-Pro
You can start and stop UAVcast-pro from the dashboard. This will simulate the exact start up sequence when Rasperry Pi boots up (if autoboot is enabled).
If you get all green leds then all selected items has started as expected.

This is a nice way to verify that UAVcast-Pro will start as expected when Raspberry Pi starts up.

##Enable  / Disable Autostart

If autostart is enable, then UAVcast-Pro will start all enabled functions every time Raspberry Pi boots up.
