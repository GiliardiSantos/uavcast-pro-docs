##FAQ

**Im not able to receive video or telemetry on my Windows computer**

* Make sure you have added video and telemetry port to your firewall rules.

**I get omxh264enc errors when starting video with USB camera**

* This could happened if you have edited etc/apt/source.list.  Set this list as default and run the UAVcast-Pro installer again.
